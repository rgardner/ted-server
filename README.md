# TED Mobile Phone Charging Station

This is the SMS server backend of my mobile phone charging station final
project for my _Technology, Education, Design_ undergraduate class in Spring 2015.

This is a simple [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) app written in Ruby and
using the Twilio API to receive and reply to text messages from the
[ted-controller](https://github.com/rgardner/ted-controller) frontend.
